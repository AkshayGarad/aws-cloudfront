# CloudFront
## 1. What is AWS CloudFront?
AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to distribute content, such as web pages, videos, and other static and dynamic content, to edge locations around the world. This helps improve the performance of web applications and reduce latency for end-users by caching content closer to them.

CloudFront works by caching content at edge locations, which are AWS data centers located around the world. When a user requests content, CloudFront will route the request to the edge location closest to the user. If the content is already cached at that edge location, CloudFront will serve it directly from the cache, reducing the time it takes to deliver the content to the user. If the content is not cached, CloudFront will retrieve it from the origin server (such as an S3 bucket or an EC2 instance) and cache it at the edge location for future requests.

CloudFront also supports various features, such as SSL/TLS encryption, custom domain names, and access control, which allow users to secure their content and control who has access to it.

Overall, CloudFront provides a scalable and reliable way to distribute content globally, improving the performance and reliability of web applications for end-users around the world.

## 6.	How can we disable Cache for CloudFront?
You can disable caching for Amazon CloudFront in a few different ways, depending on your specific requirements. Here are a few methods you can use:

1. Disable caching for specific objects: You can disable caching for specific objects by adding a query string parameter to the URL of the object. For example, you can add "?nocache" to the end of the URL to indicate that the object should not be cached. This is useful if you have a specific object that you want to prevent from being cached.

2. Set Cache-Control headers: You can set Cache-Control headers in the HTTP response from your origin server to control how CloudFront caches your content. To disable caching, you can set the "Cache-Control: no-cache" or "Cache-Control: max-age=0" header. This will tell CloudFront not to cache the object, or to revalidate it with the origin server on every request.

3. Create a new cache behavior: You can create a new cache behavior in CloudFront that disables caching for a specific path pattern. To do this, go to the CloudFront distribution settings, select "Behaviors", and then click "Create Behavior". In the behavior settings, you can set the "Minimum TTL" to 0 to disable caching for that behavior.

4. Invalidate cached objects: If you want to disable caching for all objects in a CloudFront distribution, you can invalidate the cached objects. This will remove all cached objects from the edge locations, and subsequent requests will go back to the origin server for the latest version of the content.

In summary, you can disable caching for Amazon CloudFront by adding query string parameters to specific objects, setting Cache-Control headers, creating a new cache behavior, or invalidating cached objects.

## 7.	How can I update files on Amazonâ€™s CDN?
To update files on Amazon's CDN (CloudFront), you need to follow these steps:

1. Upload the new version of the file(s) to your origin server, such as Amazon S3, where your CloudFront distribution is configured to fetch content from.
2. Optionally, you can change the name or path of the file to avoid any conflicts with the previous version of the file.
3. Invalidate the previous version of the file in CloudFront by creating an invalidation request.

To create an invalidation request:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudFront console.
2. Click on the distribution for which you want to invalidate files.
3. Click on the "Invalidations" tab.
4. Click on the "Create Invalidation" button.
5. Enter the path or paths of the files that you want to invalidate, using the following format:
    - /path/to/file.ext
    - /path/to/directory/*
6. Click the "Create Invalidation" button to submit your request.

Note that invalidation requests can take some time to process, and there may be a delay before the new version of your files is propagated to all CloudFront edge locations. Additionally, invalidation requests incur charges, so it's important to use them judiciously.

## 8.	What are 2 main components of CloudFront?
The two main components of Amazon CloudFront are:
1. Distribution: A distribution is the main configuration object in CloudFront, which represents a set of edge locations where content is cached and served from. It is created for a specific origin server, such as Amazon S3, EC2 instances, or an HTTP server running outside of AWS. A distribution can have one or more cache behaviors, which specify how CloudFront should handle incoming requests for different URLs.
2. Edge Locations: An edge location is a physical location where CloudFront caches content. Each edge location acts as a gateway between the users and the origin server, providing low-latency access to the content. CloudFront uses a global network of edge locations that are spread across multiple continents to ensure that the content is delivered from the nearest location to the user, minimizing the latency and improving the performance. 
When a user requests a file from the CloudFront distribution, the request is routed to the nearest edge location. If the file is not already cached at that edge location, CloudFront fetches the file from the origin server, caches it at the edge location, and serves it to the user. If the file is already cached at the edge location and it has not expired, CloudFront serves the file directly from the cache, without contacting the origin server.

## 9.	What is CloudFront used for?
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that is used for accelerating the delivery of static and dynamic content, such as web pages, images, videos, APIs, and software downloads. Here are some common use cases for CloudFront:
