# CloudFront
## 1. What is AWS CloudFront?
AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to distribute content, such as web pages, videos, and other static and dynamic content, to edge locations around the world. This helps improve the performance of web applications and reduce latency for end-users by caching content closer to them.

CloudFront works by caching content at edge locations, which are AWS data centers located around the world. When a user requests content, CloudFront will route the request to the edge location closest to the user. If the content is already cached at that edge location, CloudFront will serve it directly from the cache, reducing the time it takes to deliver the content to the user. If the content is not cached, CloudFront will retrieve it from the origin server (such as an S3 bucket or an EC2 instance) and cache it at the edge location for future requests.

CloudFront also supports various features, such as SSL/TLS encryption, custom domain names, and access control, which allow users to secure their content and control who has access to it.

Overall, CloudFront provides a scalable and reliable way to distribute content globally, improving the performance and reliability of web applications for end-users around the world.

## 6.	How can we disable Cache for CloudFront?
You can disable caching for Amazon CloudFront in a few different ways, depending on your specific requirements. Here are a few methods you can use:

1. Disable caching for specific objects: You can disable caching for specific objects by adding a query string parameter to the URL of the object. For example, you can add "?nocache" to the end of the URL to indicate that the object should not be cached. This is useful if you have a specific object that you want to prevent from being cached.

2. Set Cache-Control headers: You can set Cache-Control headers in the HTTP response from your origin server to control how CloudFront caches your content. To disable caching, you can set the "Cache-Control: no-cache" or "Cache-Control: max-age=0" header. This will tell CloudFront not to cache the object, or to revalidate it with the origin server on every request.

3. Create a new cache behavior: You can create a new cache behavior in CloudFront that disables caching for a specific path pattern. To do this, go to the CloudFront distribution settings, select "Behaviors", and then click "Create Behavior". In the behavior settings, you can set the "Minimum TTL" to 0 to disable caching for that behavior.

4. Invalidate cached objects: If you want to disable caching for all objects in a CloudFront distribution, you can invalidate the cached objects. This will remove all cached objects from the edge locations, and subsequent requests will go back to the origin server for the latest version of the content.

In summary, you can disable caching for Amazon CloudFront by adding query string parameters to specific objects, setting Cache-Control headers, creating a new cache behavior, or invalidating cached objects.

## 7.	How can I update files on Amazonâ€™s CDN?
To update files on Amazon's CDN (CloudFront), you need to follow these steps:

1. Upload the new version of the file(s) to your origin server, such as Amazon S3, where your CloudFront distribution is configured to fetch content from.
2. Optionally, you can change the name or path of the file to avoid any conflicts with the previous version of the file.
3. Invalidate the previous version of the file in CloudFront by creating an invalidation request.

To create an invalidation request:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudFront console.
2. Click on the distribution for which you want to invalidate files.
3. Click on the "Invalidations" tab.
4. Click on the "Create Invalidation" button.
5. Enter the path or paths of the files that you want to invalidate, using the following format:
    - /path/to/file.ext
    - /path/to/directory/*
6. Click the "Create Invalidation" button to submit your request.

Note that invalidation requests can take some time to process, and there may be a delay before the new version of your files is propagated to all CloudFront edge locations. Additionally, invalidation requests incur charges, so it's important to use them judiciously.

## 8.	What are 2 main components of CloudFront?
The two main components of Amazon CloudFront are:
1. Distribution: A distribution is the main configuration object in CloudFront, which represents a set of edge locations where content is cached and served from. It is created for a specific origin server, such as Amazon S3, EC2 instances, or an HTTP server running outside of AWS. A distribution can have one or more cache behaviors, which specify how CloudFront should handle incoming requests for different URLs.
2. Edge Locations: An edge location is a physical location where CloudFront caches content. Each edge location acts as a gateway between the users and the origin server, providing low-latency access to the content. CloudFront uses a global network of edge locations that are spread across multiple continents to ensure that the content is delivered from the nearest location to the user, minimizing the latency and improving the performance. 
When a user requests a file from the CloudFront distribution, the request is routed to the nearest edge location. If the file is not already cached at that edge location, CloudFront fetches the file from the origin server, caches it at the edge location, and serves it to the user. If the file is already cached at the edge location and it has not expired, CloudFront serves the file directly from the cache, without contacting the origin server.

## 9.	What is CloudFront used for?
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that is used for accelerating the delivery of static and dynamic content, such as web pages, images, videos, APIs, and software downloads. Here are some common use cases for CloudFront:

S3 prioritizes consistency and durability by ensuring that all objects are stored and retrieved in the same state across different regions and availability zones.
4. Access control vs content delivery: S3 provides fine-grained access control to data objects, allowing users to set permissions and policies to control who can access and modify the objects. CloudFront provides access control for content delivery by supporting various authentication and authorization methods, such as signed URLs and cookies.
5. Cost structure: CloudFront charges based on data transfer and requests, whereas S3 charges based on storage, requests, and data transfer. CloudFront is typically more expensive than S3 for content delivery, but it provides better performance and scalability for global audiences.
In summary, CloudFront is a CDN service that accelerates the delivery of content, while S3 is an object storage service that provides durable and scalable storage for data objects. Both services have their strengths and weaknesses, and they can be used together to provide a complete solution for storing and delivering content.

## 11.	Is CloudFront load balancer?
No, CloudFront is not a load balancer. It is a content delivery network (CDN) service that distributes content across multiple edge locations to improve the performance and reduce the latency for end-users. 

While both services can be used to improve the performance and scalability of web applications, they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios. Load balancers are used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances or servers, to improve the availability, scalability, and reliability of the application. Load balancers can route traffic based on various algorithms, such as round-robin, least connections, and IP hash, and they can detect and handle failures and traffic spikes.

On the other hand, CloudFront is used to distribute content across multiple edge locations, to reduce the latency and improve the performance of content delivery. CloudFront caches content at edge locations and serves it from the nearest location to the end-user, reducing the distance and time required to fetch the content from the origin server. CloudFront supports various caching policies, behaviors, and features, such as TTLs, query string parameters, cookies, signed URLs, and geo-restriction.

In summary, while both CloudFront and load balancers are used to improve the performance and scalability of web applications, they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios. CloudFront is a CDN service that accelerates content delivery, while load balancers are used to distribute traffic across multiple instances or servers.

## 12.	What is origin in CloudFront?
In Amazon CloudFront, an origin refers to the source of the content that CloudFront delivers to end-users. The origin can be an Amazon S3 bucket, an EC2 instance, a Load Balancer, or any other HTTP server that can serve the content.
When a user requests content through CloudFront, CloudFront first checks if the content is available at one of its edge locations. If the content is not available, CloudFront forwards the request to the origin server to fetch the content. CloudFront can retrieve content from multiple origins, and it can also cache the content at the edge locations for future requests.
An origin in CloudFront can be of two types: S3 origin or custom origin. An S3 origin is an S3 bucket that contains the content to be served, while a custom origin is any other HTTP server that can serve the content. CloudFront supports various customization options for origins, such as setting custom headers, modifying requests and responses, and configuring security and access controls.
In summary, the origin in CloudFront is the source of the content that CloudFront delivers to end-users. It can be an S3 bucket or any other HTTP server, and it can be customized with various settings and options.

## 13.	Is CloudFront faster than S3?
In general, CloudFront can be faster than S3 because CloudFront uses a network of edge locations to cache and serve content to end-users with low latency and high performance, while S3 serves content directly from its storage. 
CloudFront reduces the latency and improves the performance of content delivery by caching the content at edge locations closer to the end-users. When an end-user requests content through CloudFront, CloudFront serves the content from the nearest edge location that has a cached copy, reducing the distance and time required to fetch the content from the origin server. This results in faster response times and improved performance for the end-users.
On the other hand, S3 is a highly scalable, durable, and reliable object storage service that is designed for storing and retrieving large amounts of data. While S3 can also be used to serve content over the internet, it does not have the same caching and distribution capabilities as CloudFront. S3 can serve content directly from its storage, which can be fast for static content, but it may not be as fast as CloudFront for dynamic or frequently accessed content.
In summary, while both CloudFront and S3 can be used to serve content over the internet, CloudFront is generally faster than S3 due to its caching and distribution capabilities. However, the choice between the two services depends on various factors such as the type of content, the frequency of access, the geographic distribution of end-users, and the required performance and scalability.

## 14.	Can I use S3 without CloudFront?
Yes, you can use Amazon S3 without using Amazon CloudFront. S3 is a standalone object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the internet. You can use S3 to host static websites, store and distribute files, backup and archive data, and much more.
When you use S3 to serve content over the internet, the content is served directly from S3 to the end-users, without any intermediate caching or distribution. While this approach may not provide the same performance and scalability benefits as using CloudFront, it can still be useful for hosting static content or serving content to a limited number of users.
Using CloudFront with S3 can provide additional benefits such as reducing the latency and improving the performance of content delivery by caching the content at edge locations closer to the end-users. CloudFront can also provide additional features such as SSL/TLS termination, custom headers, query string parameters, cookies, and geo-restriction.
